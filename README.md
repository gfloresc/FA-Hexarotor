# FA-Hexarotor
Code for the fully actuated Hexa-rotor

To update the original PX4 firmware from the PX4 Autopilot repository, first, you need to clone the master repository into your computer with the following command
$ git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git
After that, one must replace the folders from this repository to the respective folders of the original PX4 firmware
the folder MultirotorMixer must be replaced in PX4-Autopilot/src/lib/mixer/
the folder mc_att_control must be replaced in PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/
the contents files in mc_pos_control must be replaced in PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/mc_pos_control/PositionControl/
the folder mc_rate_control must be replaced in PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/
Once all the files are replaced, it is necessary to build the firmware for the first time
$ DONT_RUN=1 make px4_sitl gazebo
this command will generate a new folder in PX4-Autopilot/build/ named px4_sitl_default. In this folder, we will replace the file mixer_multirotor_normalized.generated.h in PX4-Autopilot/build/px4_sitl_default/src/lib/mixer/MultirotorMixer/; by replacing this file, we modify the mixer par√°meters enabling the fully actuation mixing in the Hexa-rotor.
Finally, for simulation only, it is required to replace the last file typhoon_h480.sdf in PX4-Autopilot/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models/typhoon_h480/; this file is a modification of the Hexa-rotor model rotating the motors according to the calculated mixing matrix.
Now it is possible to run the SITL simulation by running
$ make px4_sitl gazebo_typhoon_h480
